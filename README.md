Visual Odometry using Stereo
===========

Odometry refers to the use of data from motion sensors to estimate change in position over time. One of the most reliable ways of estimation of 3-D structure using cameras is to use a calibrated stereo pair. Given the sequence of 3-D structures generated by the stereo camera, we can estimate the motion of the camera with respect to its environment as well as generate a 3-D map of the environment. This is usually referred to as visual SLAM (simultaneous localisation and mapping), which has wide applications in robotics and remote sensing.

We plan to implement a 6 DoF pose estimation algorithm using a calibrated stereo pair and generate a 3-D map of the environment simultaneously. We assume that scene illumination doesn't change much and most of the field of view of the camera is occupied by static parts of the environment.

We use a Gaussian Mixture Model to model each pointset and then use a measure of divergence between distributions to optimize the translation and rotation between pointsets.
